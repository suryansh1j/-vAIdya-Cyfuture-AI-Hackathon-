Lately I've had frequent headaches and a lot of nausea, especially in the mornings.

Yes, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest after eating.

Do you vomit?

I did vomit twice last week, but I haven't vomited since.

I have a dry cough at night, but I don't have shortness of breath.

Yes, I've noticed some stomach pain and once I've had a small ulcer on my tongue.
