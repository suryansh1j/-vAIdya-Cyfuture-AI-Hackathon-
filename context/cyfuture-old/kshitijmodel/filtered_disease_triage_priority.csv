Disease,Priority Score,Justification
Heart attack,1,Immediate death of heart muscle. Requires urgent intervention to prevent death or permanent heart damage.
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),1,"Acute bleeding in the brain causing rapid neurological damage, paralysis, and high risk of death."
AIDS,2,"Weakens the immune system, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. Requires lifelong management."
Alcoholic hepatitis,2,Severe inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.
Chronic cholestasis,2,Long-term bile flow obstruction can lead to irreversible liver damage and cirrhosis.
Hepatitis B,2,Chronic infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer over time.
Hepatitis C,2,Chronic infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer.
Hepatitis D,2,"Causes more severe liver disease than Hepatitis B alone, accelerating cirrhosis."
Hepatitis E,2,"Usually self-limiting but can cause acute liver failure, especially in pregnant women."
Hypoglycemia,2,"Severe low blood sugar can lead to seizures, coma, and brain damage if not treated immediately."
Jaundice,2,"A symptom, but high levels of bilirubin can be toxic, especially to the brains of newborns."
Malaria,2,"Severe forms (P. falciparum) can cause coma, seizures, and death. Requires prompt treatment to prevent complications."
Peptic ulcer diseae,2,Can lead to severe internal bleeding or perforation of the stomach wall.
Pneumonia,2,Severe infection can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis. Requires timely antibiotics.
Tuberculosis,2,Can cause permanent lung damage and spread to other organs. Untreated active TB has a high mortality rate over time.
Acne,3,"Skin condition with low risk of permanent physical harm, though it can cause scarring."
Allergy,3,"Anaphylaxis is a Priority 1 emergency, but common allergies are non-urgent."
Arthritis,3,"Causes chronic pain and joint damage, leading to disability over time."

Cervical spondylosis,3,"Age-related wear and tear of spinal disks in the neck, causing chronic pain."
Chicken pox,3,Usually mild in children but can be severe in adults or lead to shingles later in life.
Common Cold,3,"Mild, self-limiting viral infection."
Dengue,3,Generally considered non-life-threatening or slow-progressing.

Fungal infection,3,Typically localized skin infections. Invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised people are emergencies.
GERD,3,Chronic acid reflux. Can lead to long-term esophageal damage (Barrett's esophagus) but not an immediate threat.
Gastroenteritis,3,"Usually self-limiting. Dehydration is the main concern, especially in vulnerable populations."
Hyperthyroidism,3,"Speeds up metabolism. A ""thyroid storm"" is a rare, life-threatening emergency (Priority 1), but standard cases are less urgent."
Hypothyroidism,3,"Slows metabolism. Untreated long-term can lead to heart problems, but not an immediate crisis."
Impetigo,3,"Bacterial skin infection, usually not serious."
Migraine,3,Causes severe headaches but does not typically cause permanent harm.
Osteoarthristis,3,Degenerative joint disease causing chronic pain and reduced mobility.

Urinary tract infection,3,"Can progress to a serious kidney infection (pyelonephritis) if untreated, but typically manageable."
Varicose veins,3,"Enlarged veins. Can lead to clots or ulcers, but typically a slow-progressing condition."
