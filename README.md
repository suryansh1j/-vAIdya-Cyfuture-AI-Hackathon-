# VaidyaCFW  
**AI Assistant for Medical Audio & Diagnostic Notes**

**Cyfuture AI Hackathon 1.0 Submission**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

VaidyaCFW is a web application that helps doctors convert patient audio (symptoms, consultations) into **structured medical notes** and **diagnostic suggestions** using AI/ML. The goal is to save doctors‚Äô time, reduce errors, and bring advanced tools to clinics of all sizes.

- Users can **upload or record audio** (patient consultation)  
- The system transcribes and processes it via ML models  
- It outputs **structured notes / summaries / prediction hints**  
- Doctors review, edit, and finalize diagnosis  

---

## üß© Problem Statement

- Clinicians spend substantial time on **manual documentation**  
- Audio and conversation data remain **unstructured** and hard to analyze  
- Errors or omissions are common under time pressure  
- Many existing tools are not domain-specific or affordable for smaller clinics  

---

## üõ† Solution ‚Äî What VaidyaCFW Offers

- A **simple web interface** to record/upload patient audio  
- Transcription + **medical-aware processing models**  
- Outputs in the form of **structured notes** and **diagnosis suggestions**  
- Focused on **ease of adoption**, **local dialect support**, **cost-effectiveness**

---

## ‚ú® Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)

- Domain-specific: tailored to medical jargon and conditions  
- Fusion of audio + text + ML for comprehensive output  
- Lightweight and accessible ‚Äî built for low-resource settings  
- Built-in emphasis on **data privacy / compliance**  

---

## üß≠ User Flow (How It Works)

1. **Patient Visit**  
2. **Record or Upload Audio** of consultation / symptoms  
3. **System Processes** the audio via ML models  
4. **Generate Notes & Suggestions**  
5. **Doctor Reviews / Edits** ‚Üí Final Diagnosis
